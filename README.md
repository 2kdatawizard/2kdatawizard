- 👋 Hi, I’m @2kdatawizard

- 👀 I’m interested in learning from other wizards and may be teach one or two tricks back. I code in a few languages like Python, C# and C++. 
      Also got some web scripting skills in PHP and HTML but still way to go in this area
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with skilled programmmers who have previously developed or have interest in working on products for children education. 
     People with a true passion to make education available for every child in the world especially those who can't afford it
