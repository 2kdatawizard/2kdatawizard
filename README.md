- 👋 Hi, I’m @2kdatawizard

- 👀 I’m interested in learning from other wizards and may be teach one or two tricks back. I code in a few languages, like Python, C# and C++. 
      Also got some web scripting skills in React, PHP and HTML\CSS but still way to go in this area
      
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering python

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with skilled programmers who have previously developed or have an interest in working on products for child education. 
     People with a true passion to make education available for every child in the world, especially those who can't afford it
